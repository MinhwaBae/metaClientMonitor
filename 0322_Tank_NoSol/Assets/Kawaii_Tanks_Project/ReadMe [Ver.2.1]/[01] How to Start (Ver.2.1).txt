*** How to Start ***

(1) Create a new project, and import this package from Package Manager.
	Window >> Package Manager >> "My Assets".


(2) Switch the Platform when you need.
	Switch the platform to 'Android' or 'iOS' when you need touch controls.
	You can change the platform from the "Build Settings" (File >> Build Settings…).

(3) Play the demo scenes.
	You can find the demo scenes in the "Scenes" folder.
	I recommend you to first play the demo scene "99_Training".


*** About to the Sky Boxes ***
The Sky Boxes in the demo videos and games are included in "Standard Assets for Unity 4.6".
However the package has been deprecated from the Asset Store.
If you have downloaded it before, you can import it from the "My Assets" in the "Asset Store" window.
